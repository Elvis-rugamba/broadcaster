Andela Developer Challenge Product

# Project Overview  
Corruption is a huge bane to Africa’s development. African countries must develop novel and  localized solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of Broadcaster. Broadcaster  enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities  and the general public. Users can also report on things that need government intervention.

# Required Features 
1. Users can create an account and log in.  
2. Users can create a ​red-flag ​record (An incident linked to corruption).  
3. Users can create an ​intervention​ record​ ​(a call for a government agency to intervene e.g  repair bad road sections, collapsed bridges, flooding e.t.c).  
4. Users can edit their ​red-flag ​or ​intervention ​records.  
5. Users can delete their ​red-flag ​or ​intervention ​records.  
6. Users can add geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) to their ​red-flag ​or ​intervention  records​.  
7. Users can change the geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) attached to their ​red-flag ​or  intervention ​records​.  
8. Admin can change the ​status​ of a record to either ​under investigation, rejected ​(in the  event of a false claim)​ ​or​ resolved ​(in the event that the claim has been investigated and  resolved)​. 

# Optional Features  
1. Users can add images to their ​red-flag ​or​ intervention ​records, to support their claims.  
2. Users can add videos to their ​red-flag ​or​ intervention ​records, to support their claims.  
3. Users can add label tags when creating  ​red-flags​ or ​interventions ​to sub-group claims.  
4. The application should display a Google Map with Marker showing the red-flag or  intervention location. 
5. The user gets real-time email notification when Admin changes the ​status ​of their record.  
6. The user gets real-time SMS notification when Admin changes the ​status​ of their record. 
 
# NB: 
1. The user can only change the ​geolocation ​(Lat Long Coordinates)​ ​of a ​red flag/  intervention ​record when the record’s ​status​ is yet to be marked as either ​under  investigation, rejected, ​or​ resolved​.  
2. The user can only​ ​edit or delete a ​red-flag​/ ​intervention​ record when the record’s ​status  is yet to be marked as either ​under investigation, rejected, or resolved​.  
3. Only the user who created the ​red-flag ​or ​incident​ record can delete the record.
